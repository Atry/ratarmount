"""Ratarmount Core

This is the backend of ratarmount. It is intended to be used as a library.

This library offers an interface which is sufficient to work with FUSE.
This MountSource interface has methods for listing paths and getting file
metadata and contents.

The ratarmountcore library offers multiple implementations of the interface:

 - SQLiteIndexedTar: This is the oldest and most powerful implementation.
                     It supports fast access to files inside (compressed) TARs.
 - RarMountSource: An implementation for RARs using rarfile.
 - ZipMountSource: An implementation for ZIPs using zipfile.
 - FolderMountSource: An implementation taking an existing folder as input.
 - UnionMountSource: Takes multiple MountSource implementations and merges them.
 - SubvolumesMountSource: Takes multiple MountSource implementations and mounts
                          each in separate subfolders with specified names.
 - FileVersionLayer: Takes a MountSource as input, decodes the requested
                     paths, also accepting "<file>.version/<number>" paths,
                     and calls the methods of the MountSource with the given
                     file version.
 - AutoMountLayer: Takes one MountSource, goes over all its files and mounts
                   archives recursively in a similar manner to UnionMountSource.

The factory function 'openMountSource' opens one of the archive MountSource
implementations according to the file type.

Example:

    from ratarmountcore.factory import openMountSource

    archive = openMountSource("foo.tar", recursive=True)
    archive.listDir("/")
    info = archive.getFileInfo("/bar")

    print "Contents of /bar:"
    with archive.open(info) as file:
        print(file.read())
